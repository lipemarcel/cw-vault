# Implementing Accessible React Components

Accessibility (a11y) in web applications is crucial for ensuring all users can interact with your interface effectively. This is particularly important for financial applications like InfinitePay where users need to perform critical transactions.

## Key Concept: ARIA Attributes and Semantic HTML

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes and semantic HTML elements help screen readers and assistive technologies understand your application's structure and functionality.

## Practical Example:

```typescript
// Bad Practice
const PaymentButton = () => (
  <div 
    onClick={handlePayment}
    style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
  >
    Process Payment
  </div>
);

// Good Practice
const PaymentButton = () => (
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={handlePayment}
    aria-label="Process payment"
    disabled={isProcessing}
  >
    {isProcessing ? 'Processing...' : 'Process Payment'}
  </button>
);
```

## Best Practices:

1. Use semantic HTML elements (`button`, `nav`, `main`, `article`) instead of generic `div`s
2. Include proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
3. Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
4. Maintain sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
5. Test with screen readers regularly

## Implementation Tips:

- Use the React ESLint plugin `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to catch accessibility issues during development
- Implement focus management for modals and dynamic content
- Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
