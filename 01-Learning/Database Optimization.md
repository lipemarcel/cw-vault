# Effective Database Query Optimization in Next.js Applications

Database query optimization is crucial for maintaining application performance, especially in financial applications like InfinitePay. Understanding how to properly structure and optimize database queries can significantly improve response times and user experience.

## Key Concept: Query Optimization Techniques

The main strategies for optimizing database queries include:
- Proper indexing of frequently queried fields
- Minimizing the number of database round trips
- Using efficient JOIN operations
- Implementing query caching where appropriate

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Before optimization
const getTransactions = async (userId: string) => {
  const transactions = await prisma.transaction.findMany({
    where: { userId },
    include: { 
      user: true,
      merchant: true,
      // Including all relations unnecessarily
    }
  });
  return transactions;
};

// After optimization
const getTransactions = async (userId: string) => {
  const transactions = await prisma.transaction.findMany({
    where: { userId },
    select: {
      id: true,
      amount: true,
      timestamp: true,
      merchant: {
        select: {
          name: true,
          id: true
        }
      }
    }
  });
  return transactions;
};
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use specific SELECT statements instead of selecting all fields
2. Create indexes for frequently filtered or sorted columns
3. Implement pagination for large datasets
4. Use database-level caching for frequently accessed, rarely changed data

For deep diving into database optimization with Prisma and Next.js, check out the comprehensive guide at: [Database Performance Best Practices with Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization)

Remember: Monitor query performance regularly using tools like Prisma Studio or database-specific monitoring solutions to identify potential bottlenecks early.
