# CI/CD Pipeline Strategies for Next.js Applications

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is crucial for modern web applications. Here's a practical approach specifically for Next.js projects:

### Key Concept
CI/CD pipeline stages for Next.js applications typically include:
- Code linting and type checking
- Unit and integration testing
- Build verification
- Production deployment
- Post-deployment health checks

### Practical Example
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
name: Next.js CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Type Check
        run: yarn tsc --noEmit
      
      - name: Run Tests
        run: yarn test
      
      - name: Build
        run: yarn build
      
      - name: Deploy
        run: yarn deploy # Custom deployment script
```

### Best Practices
1. Always include TypeScript type checking in your CI pipeline
2. Implement staging environments for pre-production testing
3. Use environment variables for different deployment stages
4. Implement automated rollback strategies
5. Set up monitoring and alerts for deployment status

### Tips for InfinitePay Context
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Use separate environments for payment processing testing
- Implement strict security checks for payment-related code
