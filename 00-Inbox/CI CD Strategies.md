# Understanding Trunk-Based Development in CI/CD

Trunk-based development (TBD) is a source control branching strategy that encourages developers to merge small, frequent updates directly into the main branch (trunk). This approach aligns well with modern CI/CD practices and can significantly improve team velocity and code quality.

## Key Concepts

- Short-lived feature branches (< 2 days)
- Frequent integrations to main branch
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Automated testing at every commit

## Practical Example with Next.js

```typescript
// Feature flag implementation in Next.js
const FeatureFlag = ({ flag, children }) => {
  const isEnabled = useFeatureFlag(flag);
  
  return isEnabled ? children : null;
};

// Usage in a component
const NewFeature = () => {
  return (
    <FeatureFlag flag="new-payment-flow">
      <PaymentComponent />
    </FeatureFlag>
  );
};
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep branches small and focused
2. Use feature flags for incomplete features
3. Maintain comprehensive automated tests
4. Perform code reviews quickly
5. Deploy to production frequently (ideally daily)

## Implementation Tips

- Start with a robust automated testing strategy
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Implement automated code quality checks
- Set up branch protection rules
- Configure automated deployment pipelines

This comprehensive guide covers practical implementations of CI/CD pipelines specifically for Next.js applications, including deployment strategies and testing approaches.

Remember: The goal is to reduce integration pain by merging code more frequently and in smaller chunks.
