# React Security Best Practices for Payment Applications

When building payment applications like InfinitePay, security should be a top priority. Here's a focused look at essential React security practices:

## Key Concept: XSS Prevention in React

While React automatically escapes content by default, there are still potential vulnerabilities when using certain APIs. Understanding proper data sanitization and safe rendering is crucial.

## Practical Example:

```typescript
// ❌ Unsafe approach
const PaymentDetails = ({ html }) => {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />;
};

// ✅ Safe approach
const PaymentDetails = ({ content }) => {
  return <div>{content}</div>;  // Auto-escaped by React
};

// When dynamic URLs are needed:
const SafeLink = ({ url }: { url: string }) => {
  const isSafe = /^(https?:)?\/\/infinitepay\.com/.test(url);
  return isSafe ? <a href={url}>Safe Link</a> : null;
};
```

## Best Practices:

1. Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
2. Use TypeScript's strict mode to catch potential security issues
3. Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
4. Validate and sanitize all user inputs server-side
5. Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Deep Dive Resource:

Check out [OWASP React Security Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/React_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) for comprehensive security guidelines specific to React applications.

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Regular security audits and keeping dependencies updated are essential practices for maintaining a secure application.
