# Implementing React Component Testing Best Practices

Testing React components effectively is crucial for maintaining a robust codebase at InfinitePay. Here's a focused approach to component testing using React Testing Library.

## Key Concept: Component Testing Hierarchy

Follow the "Testing Trophy" principle:
- Unit tests for complex utilities
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Practical Example

```typescript
// PaymentForm.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { PaymentForm } from './PaymentForm';

describe('PaymentForm', () => {
  test('submits payment with correct values', async () => {
    const handleSubmit = jest.fn();
    
    render(<PaymentForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);
    
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText(/amount/i), {
      target: { value: '100.00' }
    });
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }));
    
    expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      amount: '100.00'
    });
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Test behavior, not implementation
2. Use role-based queries (getByRole) over test IDs
3. Write tests from user perspective
4. Mock only what's necessary (external APIs, complex animations)

## Actionable Tips

- Setup a consistent test structure across the team
- Use test-driven development for complex features
- Implement CI checks for test coverage

## Recommended Resource

Kent C. Dodds' "Testing JavaScript" course (testingjavascript.com) provides comprehensive coverage of modern testing practices, specifically for React applications.

Remember: Good tests should give you confidence to refactor and enhance features without breaking existing functionality.
