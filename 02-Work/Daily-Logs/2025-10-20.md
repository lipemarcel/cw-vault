## üß† What I Learned

### Technical
- Next.js 15 automatically generates meta tags from icon files (icon.png and apple-icon.png)
- SSR rendering of CSS classes prevents FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) better than client-side JavaScript
- Applying dark mode class to `document.documentElement` instead of `document.body` aligns with Tailwind's dark mode implementation
- Using `Config.getOrigin()` singleton for origin-based conditional logic in shared components

### Domain Knowledge
- Pay Jim users are primarily US-based, requiring different UX defaults than Brazilian users
- Icon branding consistency is critical for brand recognition across devices (favicon vs Apple touch icon)

### Process/Tools
- Used InitDarkModeStore component for managing dark mode state without direct DOM manipulation
- Comprehensive test coverage for SSR rendering scenarios prevents regression
