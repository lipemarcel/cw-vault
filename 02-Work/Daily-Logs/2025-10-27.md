## ‚úÖ What I Did Today

### Code & Features
- **Social Commerce - Stock-Aware Variation Selection** (#cnp)
  - Implemented smart product variation selection that prioritizes in-stock items
  - Updated `getDefaultVariation()` in `advertise.ts`:
    - Prioritizes default variation if it has stock
    - Falls back to first available variation with stock
    - Maintains original behavior when all variations are out of stock
  - Integrated stock-aware logic into `getProductInfo()` in `product-info.ts`
  - Added 24 comprehensive test cases:
    - 12 tests in `advertise.test.ts` (17 assertions)
    - 12 tests in `product-info.test.ts` (36 assertions)
  - All tests passing ‚úÖ

### PRs & Reviews

  - Customer feedback from team building event

## üß† What I Learned

### Technical
- Implemented fallback logic with multiple priority levels (default ‚Üí first available ‚Üí original)
- Comprehensive test coverage strategies: edge cases, boundary conditions, and type compatibility
- Type assertions for maintaining compatibility while improving functionality

### Domain Knowledge
- E-commerce product variation management and inventory prioritization
- Customer journey impact: showing "out of stock" when alternatives exist is a significant UX friction point
- Real customer feedback from team building translates directly to product improvements

### Process/Tools
- Quick turnaround from customer feedback to PR (team building ‚Üí implementation in one day)
- Test-first approach: 24 test cases ensuring all scenarios are covered
- Clear PR documentation with mermaid diagrams for logic flow visualization
