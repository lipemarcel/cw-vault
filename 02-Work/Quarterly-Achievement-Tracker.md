2. Categorize under the four evaluation pillars
3. When quarterly review time comes, Claude Code can generate your responses automatically

4. **Link everything**: Connect to PRs, meeting notes, project docs
5. **Don't overthink**: Quick bullet points are enough, Claude Code will polish them later
6. **Celebrate wins**: Include both big and small achievements
