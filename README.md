## Automation Features

This vault includes several automated workflows powered by GitHub Actions:

### Daily Learning Notes
1. **GitHub Actions workflow** runs daily at 9 AM UTC (6 AM BRT)
2. **Claude generates** a focused learning note on a random tech topic
3. **Note automatically commits** to `00-Inbox/` on main branch
4. **Duplicate prevention** - skips if a note on that topic already exists

**Topics Covered**: React Server Components, TypeScript, Next.js optimization, Testing, Monorepo patterns, and more.

### Daily Work Logs
1. **Automated creation** every weekday at 8 AM UTC (5 AM BRT)
2. **Creates log from template** in `02-Work/Daily-Logs/`
3. **Date-based naming** (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
4. **Prevents duplicates** - skips if log already exists

### Inbox Processing (NEW)
1. **Runs every Friday** at 7 PM UTC (4 PM BRT)
2. **Analyzes tags** in inbox notes automatically
3. **Moves notes** to appropriate folders based on tags
4. **Commits changes** directly to main branch

**Tag-based routing**:
- `#meeting`, `#bug`, `#feature`, `#pr-review` ‚Üí `02-Work/`
- `#learning`, `#doc` ‚Üí `01-Learning/` or `03-Projects/`
- `#done` ‚Üí `04-Archive/`
- No clear tags ‚Üí Stays in inbox

### Manual Triggers
All workflows can be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Obsidian installed
- Git configured
- GitHub repository created

### Environment Setup
To enable daily learning notes:

1. Create a GitHub repository for this vault
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repository secrets
3. Push this vault to the repository
4. The workflow will run automatically daily

### Anthropic API Key
Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Usage

### Creating Notes

1. **Quick capture** - Create notes in `00-Inbox/`
2. **Add tags** - Use 1-3 tags from the tag system (see CLAUDE.md)
3. **Process regularly** - Review inbox and move to appropriate folders

Example frontmatter:
```markdown
---
created: 2025-10-14
tags: [meeting, cnp, feature]
---

# Meeting: CNP Feature Discussion
...
```

### Workflow

- **Inbox** ‚Üí Automated processing every Friday (or manual with proper tags)
- **Work notes** ‚Üí Archive when completed (use `#done` tag)
- **Learning notes** ‚Üí Keep in Learning folder for reference
- **Projects** ‚Üí Move to Archive when finished
- **Daily logs** ‚Üí Created automatically each weekday morning

### Notes on Automation

- **Daily learning notes** appear in `00-Inbox/` each day at 9 AM UTC
- **Daily work logs** are created in `02-Work/Daily-Logs/` each weekday at 8 AM UTC
- **Inbox processing** runs every Friday at 7 PM UTC - notes with proper tags are moved automatically
- **Manual processing** is still available - you can move notes anytime or trigger workflows manually

## ü§ñ Claude Code Integration

This vault is designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code (AI assistant).

### What Claude Can Do

**Daily Work Logs:**
```
"Create today's daily work log"
"Add PR review for cnp#760 to my log"
"Show me this week's daily logs"
"Summarize my work this week"
```

**Quarterly Reviews:**
```
"Update my quarterly tracker with this week's work"
"Generate my Q4 self-evaluation"
"What achievements am I missing for [pillar]?"
```

**Git Operations:**
```
"Help me resolve this merge conflict"
"Check git status and help me commit"
"Explain this git error: [error message]"
```

**Note Management:**
```
"Create a new learning note about [topic]"
"Move completed work to archive"
"Find all notes tagged with #bug"
```

### How It Works

1. **Claude reads CLAUDE.md** - Understands vault structure and rules
2. **Intelligent placement** - Creates notes in correct folders
3. **Consistent tagging** - Applies tags following guidelines
4. **Smart linking** - Connects related notes automatically
5. **Context-aware** - Knows your projects and repositories

**See full documentation**: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)

## Git Workflows

This vault uses Git for version control with automated GitHub Actions creating commits daily. This can occasionally lead to merge conflicts.

### Daily Git Routine
1. **Morning**: `git pull origin main` before starting work
2. **During work**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages
3. **End of day**: `git pull` then `git push origin main`

### When Conflicts Happen
- Don't panic! Conflicts are normal with automated workflows
- See [[Git Workflow and Troubleshooting Guide]] for step-by-step resolution
- Ask Claude: "Help me resolve this merge conflict"

### Common Commands
```bash
git status              # Check current state
git pull origin main    # Sync with remote
git add <file>          # Stage changes
git commit -m "msg"     # Commit changes
git push origin main    # Push to remote
```

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This vault uses three automated workflows:

1. **`daily-learning.yml`** - Generates learning notes with Claude AI (daily at 9 AM UTC)
2. **`create-daily-log.yml`** - Creates daily work logs (weekdays at 8 AM UTC)
3. **`process-inbox.yml`** - Organizes inbox notes by tags (Fridays at 7 PM UTC)

All workflows can be found in `.github/workflows/` and can be triggered manually.
