## Daily Learning

This vault includes an automated daily learning system powered by Claude AI:

### How It Works
1. **GitHub Actions workflow** runs daily at 9 AM UTC (6 AM BRT)
2. **Claude generates** a focused learning note on a random tech topic
3. **Note lands in `00-Inbox/`** automatically
4. **Pull Request created** for review
5. **Merge to vault** and optionally move to `01-Learning/` after review

### Topics Covered
- React Server Components
- TypeScript advanced types
- Next.js optimization
- Testing best practices
- Monorepo patterns
- And more...

### Manual Trigger
You can also trigger the workflow manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Obsidian installed
- Git configured
- GitHub repository created

### Environment Setup
To enable daily learning notes:

1. Create a GitHub repository for this vault
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repository secrets
3. Push this vault to the repository
4. The workflow will run automatically daily

### Anthropic API Key
Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Usage

### Creating Notes

1. **Quick capture** - Create notes in `00-Inbox/`
2. **Add tags** - Use 1-3 tags from the tag system (see CLAUDE.md)
3. **Process regularly** - Review inbox and move to appropriate folders

Example frontmatter:
```markdown
---
created: 2025-10-14
tags: [meeting, cnp, feature]
---

# Meeting: CNP Feature Discussion
...
```

### Workflow

- **Inbox** ‚Üí Process daily, move to proper folders
- **Work notes** ‚Üí Archive when completed
- **Learning notes** ‚Üí Keep in Learning folder for reference
- **Projects** ‚Üí Move to Archive when finished

### Daily Learning Notes

Review daily PRs and merge to continuously build your knowledge base. Notes start in `00-Inbox/` and can be moved to `01-Learning/` if you want to keep them as permanent reference.
