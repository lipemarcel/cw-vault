## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Obsidian installed
- Git configured
- GitHub repository created

### Environment Setup
To enable daily learning notes:

1. Create a GitHub repository for this vault
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repository secrets
3. Push this vault to the repository
4. The workflow will run automatically daily

### Anthropic API Key
Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Usage

### Creating Notes

1. **Quick capture** - Create notes in `00-Inbox/`
2. **Add tags** - Use 1-3 tags from the tag system (see CLAUDE.md)
3. **Process regularly** - Review inbox and move to appropriate folders

Example frontmatter:
```markdown
---
created: 2025-10-14
tags: [meeting, cnp, feature]
---

# Meeting: CNP Feature Discussion
...
```

### Workflow

- **Inbox** → Automated processing every Friday (or manual with proper tags)
- **Work notes** → Archive when completed (use `#done` tag)
- **Learning notes** → Keep in Learning folder for reference
- **Projects** → Move to Archive when finished
- **Daily logs** → Created automatically each weekday morning

### Notes on Automation

- **Daily learning notes** appear in `00-Inbox/` each day at 9 AM UTC
- **Daily work logs** are created in `02-Work/Daily-Logs/` each weekday at 8 AM UTC
- **Inbox processing** runs every Friday at 7 PM UTC - notes with proper tags are moved automatically
- **Manual processing** is still available - you can move notes anytime or trigger workflows manually

## Git Workflows

This vault uses Git for version control with automated GitHub Actions creating commits daily. This can occasionally lead to merge conflicts.

### Daily Git Routine
1. **Morning**: `git pull origin main` before starting work
2. **During work**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages
3. **End of day**: `git pull` then `git push origin main`

### When Conflicts Happen
- Don't panic! Conflicts are normal with automated workflows
- See [[Git Workflow and Troubleshooting Guide]] for step-by-step resolution
- Ask Claude: "Help me resolve this merge conflict"

### Common Commands
```bash
git status              # Check current state
git pull origin main    # Sync with remote
git add <file>          # Stage changes
git commit -m "msg"     # Commit changes
git push origin main    # Push to remote
```
