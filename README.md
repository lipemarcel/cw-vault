## Daily Learning

This vault includes an automated daily learning system powered by Claude AI:

### How It Works
1. **GitHub Actions workflow** runs daily at 9 AM UTC (6 AM BRT)
2. **Claude generates** a focused learning note on a random tech topic
3. **Pull Request created** automatically for review
4. **Merge to vault** after reviewing the content

### Topics Covered
- React Server Components
- TypeScript advanced types
- Next.js optimization
- Testing best practices
- Monorepo patterns
- And more...

### Manual Trigger
You can also trigger the workflow manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git configured
- GitHub repository created

### Environment Setup
To enable daily learning notes:
