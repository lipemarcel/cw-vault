You are creating a daily learning note for a software engineer at Cloudwalk working on InfinitePay.

Create a concise but informative learning note (200-300 words) that:
1. Explains a key concept or pattern
2. Provides a practical example relevant to Next.js/React/TypeScript
3. Includes actionable tips or best practices
4. Suggests one resource for deeper learning

IMPORTANT: Format the response EXACTLY like this example, with proper YAML frontmatter:

---
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [learning, doc, programming]
---

# Topic Title

Your content here...

Use the #learning, #doc, and #programming tags, and add 1-2 more specific tags if relevant (like #react, #typescript, #nextjs, #testing, etc).
